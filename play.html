            1. Shuffle the cards and try to find all the matching pairs.
            <br>
            2. On each turn, a player turns over any two cards (one at a time) and keeps them if the cards match.
            <br>
            3. If they successfully match a pair, they get to keep the cards, and that player gets another turn. 
            <br>
            4. When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same position).
            <br> 
            5.The person with the most pairs at the end of the game wins.
            <br>
            Hint: Trick is to remember which cards are where.
